# Design and Analysis of Algorithms [LAB] - CS39001

This repository contains C programs for the **Algorithms Laboratory (CS39001)** course at KIIT University for the Autumn 2025 semester. The labs cover fundamental data structures and algorithmic techniques as outlined in the course manual.

## Repository Structure

The programs are organized by "Day" folders, corresponding to the lab sessions.

## Utility Programs

**`sample.c`**: This program is a utility to generate and optionally sort an array of integers, which can be useful for testing the other lab programs.

## My Progress

I've successfully completed all assignments up to **Day 10**, including several additional programs from the lab manual. I'll be updating this repository regularly as I attend more lab classes and complete further assignments. Stay tuned for more algorithms! ðŸš€

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of the C programs:

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the `.c` file in your terminal.

2.  Compile the program using a C compiler (like GCC):

    ```bash
    gcc <program_name>.c -o <output_executable_name>
    ```

    For example: `gcc Day1/Lab1-1.c -o Lab1-1`

3.  Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./<output_executable_name>
    ```

    For example: `./Lab1-1`

Some programs might require specific input files or command-line arguments as described in their respective comments or the lab manual.

## .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file is configured to ignore compiled executables (`*.exe`) to keep the repository clean.
